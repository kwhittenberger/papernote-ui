# Bug: Gutter Dots Vertically Centered Instead of Top Third

## Description
The PageNavigation gutter dots are currently positioned in the vertical center of the page gutter. They should be positioned in the top third of the gutter for better UX.

## Current Behavior
Gutter dots appear in the middle of the gutter area vertically.

## Expected Behavior
Gutter dots should appear in the top third of the gutter area, making them easier to access when navigating a page.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open any page that uses PageLayout with multiple sections
2. Observe the gutter dots positioning
3. Notice they are centered vertically instead of aligned to the top third

## Priority
Medium

## Component
PageLayout / PageNavigation
